Version 2.0.0, BIG UPDATE:

Cryptocam no longer uses OpenPGP or ffmpeg to encrypt videos. That means:
 - better encryption with age (X25519 and Chacha20) that is impossible to configure insecurely
   Note: Cryptocam was always secure by default, but you can generate weak GPG keys if you try hard enough
 - key import by scanning qr codes instead of copying keyfiles
 - no dependency on OpenKeychain anymore
 - less bugs and crashes due to interaction with OpenKeychain
 - much smaller APK download
 - more easily auditable codebase by not including libavformat

A new version of the Cryptocam Companion app is required to generate keys and decrypt videos recorded
with this version.
